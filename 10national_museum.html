        <p>The National Museum, New Delhi, as we see it today, has an interesting beginning. The blueprint for
            establishing the National Museum in Delhi was prepared by the Maurice Gwyer Committee in May 1946. An
            Exhibition of Indian Art, consisting of selected artefacts from various museums of India was organized by
            the Royal Academy, London with the cooperation of Government of India and Britain. The Exhibition went on
            display in the galleries of Burlington House, London during the winter months of 1947-48. It was decided to
            display the same collection in Delhi, before the return of exhibits to their respective museums. An
            exhibition was organized in the the RashtrapatiBhawan (President's residence), New Delhi in 1949, which
            turned out to be a great success. This event proved responsible for the creation of the National Museum.

            The success of this Exhibition led to the idea that advantage should be taken of this magnificent collection
            to build up the nucleus collection of the National Museum. State Governments, Museum authorities and private
            donors, who had participated in the exhibition, were approached for the gift or loan of artefacts, and most
            of them responded generously.
            On August 15, 1949, the National Museum, New Delhi, was inaugurated in the Rashtrapati Bhawan by Shri R.C.
            Rajagopalachari, the Governor-General of India. The foundation of the present building was laid by Pandit
            Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, on May 12, 1955. The first phase of the National
            Museumbuilding was formally inaugurated by Dr. SarvepalliRadhakrishnan, the Vice President of India, on
            December 18, 1960. The second phase of the building was completed in 1989.
