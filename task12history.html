        <h1 style="color: rgb(6, 20, 146);font-size: 1cm;"><b><i>History of Delhi</i></b></h1>
    </center>
    <div class="data">
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">Delhi has a long history, and has been an important political centre of India as the
            capital of several empires.
            Earliest coverage of Delhi's history is in the onset of the Tomar's kingdom in the 8th century. It is
            considered
            to be a city built, destroyed and rebuilt several times, as outsiders who successfully invaded the Indian
            Subcontinent would ransack the existing capital city in Delhi, and those who came to conquer and stay would
            be
            so impressed by the city's strategic location as to make it their capital and rebuild it in their own way.
        </p>

            <h2><i>Mention in epics</i></h2>
        </center>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">A long-standing tradition associates Delhi with Indraprastha and identifies the
            legendary city with the village
            Indarpat, which survived until the early 20th century within the Purana Qila. There is no tangible
            archeological
            evidence, however, which links the excavated 'painted greyware' at Purana Qila with the Bharata Khanda
            site.The legendary ancient city of Indraprastha is mentioned in the ancient Indian
            epic Mahabharata probably compiled between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE, with the oldest
            preserved
            parts not much older than around 400 BCE.

            There was Ochre Coloured Pottery culture in Red fort area which began around c.2000 BCE according to carbon
            dating. Around c.1200 BCE the region was inhabited by people of Painted Grey Ware culture which corresponds
            to
            Vedic Period. Significant prehistoric sites in Delhi include Anangpur (in the Badarpur region), as well as
            Harappan excavations near Narela and Nand Nagari.</p>

        </center>

        <h3>Tomaras</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">Anangpal Tomar founded Delhi in 1052. A VS 1383 inscription in Delhi Museum confirms
            the
            founding of Delhi by the Tomars.
            He established the Tomar Dynasty of Delhi in the early 8th century and built his capital at the Anangpur
            village
            in Haryana. The Anangpur Dam was built during his reign; the Surajkund during the reign of his son Surajpal.
        </p>

        <h3>Chauhan</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">The Rajput Chahamana (Chauhan) kings of Ajmer conquered Lal Kot in 1180 and renamed
            it
            Qila Rai Pithora. The Chauhan king Prithviraj III was defeated in 1192 by Muhammad Ghori in the Second
            Battle of
            Tarain, solidifying Muslim presence in northern India and shattering Rajput power in the Indo-Gangetic
            Plain.

        </center>
        <h3>Delhi Sultanate</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">From 1206, Delhi became the capital of the Delhi Sultanate under the Slave Dynasty.
            The first Sultan of Delhi, Qutb-ud-din Aybak, was a former slave who rose through the ranks to become a
            general, a governor and then Sultan of Delhi. Qutb-ud-din started the construction of the Qutub Minar, a
            recognisable symbol of Delhi, to commemorate his victory but died before its completion. In the Qutb complex
            he also constructed the Quwwat-al-Islam, which is the earliest extant mosque in India.
            He was said to have destroyed twenty-seven Jain temples initially housed in the Qutb complex and pillaged
            exquisitely carved pillars and building material from their debris for this mosque, many of which can still
            be seen.</p>

        <h3>Timur</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">In 1398, Timur Lang invaded India on the pretext that the Muslim sultans of Delhi
            were too tolerant of their Hindu subjects. After defeating the armies of Nasiruddin Mahmud of Tughlaq
            dynasty, on 15 December 1398, Timur entered Delhi on 18 December 1398, and the city was sacked, destroyed,
            and left in ruins, and over 100,000 war prisoners were killed as well. In 1526, following the First
            Battle of Panipat, Zahiruddin Babur, the former ruler of Fergana, defeated the last Afghan Lodi sultan and
            founded the Mughal dynasty which ruled from Delhi, Agra and Lahore.</p>

            <h2><i>Early Modern period (16th-18th centuries CE)</i></h2>
        </center>

        <h3>Babur and Humayun (1526-1556)</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">The first Mughal Emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Agra, unlike the preceding
            Delhi Sultanate.
            In the mid-16th century there was an interruption in the Mughal rule of India as Sher Shah Suri defeated
            Humayun and forced him to flee to Persia. Sher Shah Suri built the sixth city of Delhi, as well as the old
            fort known as Purana Qila, even though this city was settled since the ancient era. After Sher Shah Suri's
            death in 1545, his son Islam Shah took the reins of north India from Delhi. Islam Shah ruled from Delhi till
            1553 when Hindu king Hemu, became the Prime Minister and Chief of Army of Adil Shah. Hemu fought and won 22
            battles in all against rebels and twice against Akbar's army in Agra and Delhi, without losing any. After
            defeating Akbar's army on 7 October 1556 at Tughlaqabad fort area in Battle of Delhi (1556), Hemu acceded to
            Delhi throne and established Hindu Raj in North India for a brief period, and was bestowed with the title
            'Vikramaditya', at his coronation in Purana Quila, Delhi. Hemu was defeated at the second battle of Panipat
            by Mughal forces led by Akbar's regent Bairam Khan, thus reinstating Mughal rule in the region. </p>

        <h3>Akbar to Aurangzeb (1556-1707)</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">The third and greatest Mughal emperor, Akbar, continued to ruled from Agra,
            resulting in a decline in the fortunes of Delhi. In the mid-17th century, the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan
            (1628-1658) built the city that sometimes bears his name Shahjahanabad, the seventh city of Delhi that is
            now commonly known as the old city or old Delhi. This city contains a number of significant
            architectural features, including the Red Fort (Lal Qila) and the Jama Masjid. The city served as the
            capital of the later Mughal Empire from 1638 onward, when Shah Jahan transferred the capital back from Agra.

            Aurangzeb (1658-1707) crowned himself as emperor in Delhi in 1658 at the Shalimar garden
            with a second coronation in 1659. After 1680, the Mughal Empire's influence declined rapidly as the Hindu
            Maratha Empire rose to prominence.</p>

        <h3>Decline of Mughals and rise of Marathas</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">he Mughal Empire suffered several blows due to invasions from Marathas, Jats,
            Afghans and Sikhs. In 1737, Bajirao I marched towards Delhi with a huge army. The Marathas defeated the
            Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. The Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory
            against the Mughals.[citation needed] In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less than
            three hours against the numerically outnumbered but military superior Persian army led by Nader Shah during
            his invasion after which he completely sacked and looted Delhi, the Mughal capital, followed by massacre for
            2 days, killing over 30,000 civilians and carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the
            Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. Nader eventually agreed to leave the city and India after forcing the Mughal
            emperor Muhammad Shah I to beg him for mercy and granting him the keys of the city and the royal
            treasury. A treaty signed in 1752 made Marathas the protector of the Mughal throne at Delhi. In 1753
            Jat ruler Suraj Mal attacked Delhi. He defeated Nawab of Delhi Ghazi-ud-din (second) and captured Delhi in
            the Capture of Delhi. Jats sacked Delhi from 9 May to 4 June. Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded North
            India for the fourth time in early 1757. He entered Delhi in January 1757 and kept the Mughal emperor under
            arrest. In August 1757, the Marathas once again attacked Delhi, decisively defeating Najib-ud-Daula and his
            Rohilla Afghan army in the Battle of Delhi (1757). Later, Ahmad Shah Durrani conquered Delhi in 1761,
            after the Third Battle of Panipat in which the Marathas were decisively defeated. Later, a treaty was made
            between the Marathas and Afghans that the Marathas would have all the lands east of the Sutlej river. Thus,
            the Marathas established full control over the city. Under the leadership of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and
            Baghel Singh, Delhi was briefly conquered by the Sikh Empire in early 1783 in the Battle of Delhi (1783).

        <h3>Company rule</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">In 1803, during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the forces of British East India
            Company defeated the Maratha forces in the Battle of Delhi (1803), ending the Maratha rule over the
            city. As a result, Delhi came under the control of British East India Company, and became a part of the
            North-Western Provinces. The Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II remained a mere figurehead. </p>

        <h3>Revolt of 1857</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">The Indian Rebellion of 1857 sought to end Company Rule in India. On 11 May, the
            mutineers reached and captured Delhi, and declared Bahadur Shah Zafar II the Emperor of India, and the
            Emperor held his first court in many years. However, the British returned and laid siege to Delhi on 8 June
            1857. On 21 September, Delhi finally fell into the hands of British troops. The city received significant
            damage during the battle. Afterwards, the last titular Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II was captured and
            exiled to Rangoon.

            Delhi passed into the direct control of British Government in 1857 after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and
            the remaining Mughal territories were annexed as a part of British India.</p>

        <h3>British Raj</h3>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">Calcutta was the capital of British India till 1911 but in 1911 at the Delhi Durbar
            of 1911, held at the Coronation Park, King George V announced the shifting of the capital to Delhi. New
            Delhi designed by the British architect Edwin Lutyens was inaugurated in 1931 after its construction was
            delayed due to World War I. New Delhi was officially declared as the seat of the Government of India
            after independence in 1947.</p>

            <h2><i>Post-Independence (1947-present)</i></h2>
        </center>
        <p style="font-size:1.2em;">During the partition of India, around five lakh Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from
            West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three lakh Muslim residents of the city migrated to
            Pakistan. Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and
            are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus. Migration to Delhi from the rest of India
            continues (as of 2013), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is
            declining.

            The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the Chief
            Commissioner's Province of Delhi. The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the
            Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi. The Act gave
            Delhi its own legislative assembly along Civil lines, though with limited powers.

            After 1967 relations between Hindus and Muslims deteriorated to the level that there was a significant
            uptick in the number of riots and other disruption of civil life. One of the most significant was the 1973
            riot in Bao Hindu Rao area, which resulted in the injury of 18 police officers and financial losses
            estimated to be around 500,000 Rupees, according to police sources. Another significant riot happened on 5
            May 1974 in the Sadar Bazar area between Hindus and Muslims in which 11 people were killed and 92 were
            injured. This riot was the worst in Delhi since independence. The Centre for the Study of Developing
            Societies carried out a survey in nearby areas that showed significant division between Hindus and Muslims
            who saw each other negatively.

            In 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273-236 BCE) was discovered near Sriniwaspuri. Two
            sandstone pillars inscribed with the edicts of Ashoka were brought to by Firuz Shah Tughluq in the 14th
            century already exist in Delhi. </p>
