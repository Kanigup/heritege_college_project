        <p>Lodi Gardens is a city park situated in New Delhi, India. Spread over 90 acres (360,000 m2), it contains
            Mohammed Shah's Tomb, the Tomb of Sikandar Lodi, the Shisha Gumbad and the Bara Gumbad, architectural
            works of the 15th century by Lodis - who ruled parts of northern India and Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
            province of modern-day Pakistan, from 1451 to 1526. The site is now protected by the Archaeological Survey
            of India (ASI).
            Lodi Gardens is popular for exercise and walking enthusiasts

            The gardens are situated between Khan Market and Safdarjung's Tomb on Lodi Road and is a popular spot for
            morning walks for the Delhites.
            In the middle of the gardens is the Bara Gumbad ("Big Dome"), it consists of a large rubble-construct dome
            and is not a tomb but was constructed as a gateway to either the attached three domed masjid (mosque) or
            a large walled enclosure. Both the Bara Gumbad and the mosque were built in 1494 during the reign of
            Sikander Lodi, there is also a residence surrounding a central courtyard, where the remains of a water tank
            can be seen. Opposite the Bara Gumbad is the Shisha Gumbad ("mirror dome") for the glazed tiles used in its
            construction, which contains graves, whose occupants are not clearly identifiable (either an unknown family
            of Sikandar Lodi's court or Bahlul Lodi)
