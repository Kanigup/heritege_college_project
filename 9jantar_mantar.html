        <p>Jantar Mantar is located in the modern city of New Delhi. “Jantar Mantar” literally means “instruments for
            measuring the harmony of the heavens”. It consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments. The site is
            one of five built by Maharaja Jai Singh II of Jaipur, from 1723 onwards, revising the calendar and
            astronomical tables. Jai Singh, born in 1688 into a royal Rajput family that ruled the regional kingdom, was
            born into an era of education that maintained a keen interest in astronomy. There is a plaque fixed on one
            of the structures in the Jantar Mantar observatory in New Delhi that was placed there in 1910 mistakenly
            dating the construction of the complex to the year 1710. Later research, though, suggests 1724 as the actual
            year of construction. Its height is 723 feet (220 m).

            The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and
            movements of the sun, moon and planets. Some of these purposes nowadays would be classified as astronomy.

            Completed in 1724, the Delhi Jantar Mantar had decayed considerably by 1857 uprising. The Ram Yantra, the
            Samrat Yantra, the Jai Prakash Yantra and the Misra Yantra are the distinct instruments of Jantar Mantar.
            The most famous of these structure, the Jaipur, had also deteriorated by the end of the nineteenth century
            until in 1901 Maharaja Ram Singh set out to restore the instrument.</p>
