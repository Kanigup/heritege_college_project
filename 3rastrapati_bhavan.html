        <p>Rashtrapati Bhavan, home to the President of the world's largest democracy, epitomizes India,s strength, its
            democratic traditions and secular character.

            Rashtrapati Bhavan was the creation of architects of exceptional imagination and masterfulness, Sir Edwin
            Lutyens and Herbert Baker. It was Sir Lutyens who conceptualized the H shaped building, covering an area of
            5 acres on a 330 acre estate. This mansion has a total of 340 rooms spread over four floors, 2.5 kilometres
            of corridors and 190 acres of garden area.

            Painstaking efforts of thousands of labourers including masons, carpenters, artists, carvers, and cutters
            saw the completion of this masterwork in the year 1929. Originally built as the residence for the Viceroy of
            India, Viceroy's House as it was then called, has metamorphosed into today's Rashtrapati Bhavan. From being
            a symbol of imperial domination and power, it is today emblematic of Indian democracy and its secular,
            plural and inclusive traditions. Former President of India, Shri R. Venkataraman has rightly said, “Nature
            and man, rock and architecture, have rarely collaborated to so fine a purpose as in the fashioning of the
            magnificent Rashtrapati Bhavan.”

            When constructed, it was called the Viceroy's House. The name changed to Government House on August 15, 1947
            when India became independent. Finally, its name was changed to Rashtrapati Bhavan during the term of
            President Dr. Rajendra Prasad.
