        <p>The Qutb Minar,  is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of
            the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar
            Rajputs. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It is one
            of the most visited tourist spots in the city, mostly built between 1199 and 1220.

            It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c. 1190, which was
            constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower. The surfaces of both are
            elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted
            with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage. In general,
            minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.
            The Qutb Minar was built over the ruins of the Lal Kot, the citadel of Dhillika. Qutub Minar was begun
            after the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, which was started around 1192 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, first ruler of the
            Delhi Sultanate.
            It is usually thought that the tower is named for Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who began it. It is also possible that
            it is named after Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki a 13th-century sufi saint, because Shamsuddin Iltutmish was
            a devotee of his.
